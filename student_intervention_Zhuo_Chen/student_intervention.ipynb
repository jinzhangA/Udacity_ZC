    "- What are the general applications of this model? What are its strengths and weaknesses?\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive Bayes Classification is suitable for classification of nominal values.  For example, text classification and document categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strengths: 1. Naive Bayes classifiers are easy to implement and apply 2. The performance of NB classifier will not be seriously affect by high dimensionality 3. The speed of training and testing is relatively fast\n",
    "\n",
    "Weaknesse: 1. If the features are highly dependent, the assumption when using NB classifier that the features are independent will cause poor performance of this model. 2. The maximum likelihood may cause overfitting on training set. 3. The performance is sensitive to the quality of the data preparation.\n",
    "- Given what you know about the data so far, why did you choose this model to apply?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, MultinomialNB is used as a classifier. The reason for choosing this Naive Bayes it that there is no strong and obvious connection and/or dependence among the features. As a result, we can assume that the features are independent, though some of the features may have some connection in real life. The reason for choosing Multinomial module rather than  GaussianNB is that date set mainly contains discreet features, which is not suiable for GaussianNB. Also the number of features of this data set is 30, which is relatively large number of features. Since NB classifier is good with high dimensionality, this is also a reason for choosing it."

The similarity can be discribed as how close their features are and this can be calculated as the numerical difference. After that, k most similar samples from the existing cases will be selected to vote that the new input case should be classified into the class they belong to. The class here is whether the student passes the exam. Sometimes, we can assign more weight to the samples closer to the input case in the voting process.
